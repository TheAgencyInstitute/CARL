## Reporting a Vulnerability

The CARL project takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@theagencyinstitute.org
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce if possible

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Detailed Analysis**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have had time to update

### Security Considerations

CARL handles sensitive AI model data and GPU operations. Key security areas include:

#### Memory Safety
- GPU memory management
- CPU-GPU data transfers
- Buffer overflow prevention
- Memory leak prevention

#### AI Model Security
- Model parameter protection
- Training data privacy
- Adversarial attack resistance
- Model extraction prevention

#### GPU Operations
- Vulkan API usage security
- Compute shader validation
- GPU memory isolation
- Driver vulnerability mitigation

#### Dependencies
- Nova framework security updates
- Third-party library vulnerabilities
- Submodule security monitoring
- Build system security

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, especially from external sources
2. **Memory Management**: Use safe memory operations and proper cleanup
3. **GPU Operations**: Validate GPU buffers and compute shader parameters
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
5. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to latest secure versions

#### For Users
1. **System Updates**: Keep GPU drivers and system libraries updated
2. **Model Sources**: Only use AI models from trusted sources
3. **Data Privacy**: Be cautious with sensitive training data
4. **Network Security**: Secure any network-based model operations

### Vulnerability Categories

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- GPU memory corruption
- Model parameter extraction
- Privilege escalation

#### High
- Local denial of service
- Information disclosure
- GPU driver crashes
- Memory leaks in training loops

#### Medium
- Input validation bypasses
- Error message information leaks
- Performance degradation attacks
- Build system vulnerabilities

#### Low
- Documentation inaccuracies
- Non-security configuration issues
- Minor information leaks

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after verification. Users should:

1. Subscribe to security notifications
2. Update promptly when patches are available
3. Test security updates in non-production environments first
4. Report any issues with security patches immediately

### Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

1. Work with security researchers to verify and fix issues
2. Credit researchers who report issues responsibly
3. Coordinate disclosure timing to protect users
4. Provide clear communication about security updates

### Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:
- Email: security@theagencyinstitute.org  
- GPG Key: [To be provided]
- Response Time: 48 hours maximum

For non-security issues, please use the normal GitHub issue process.

### Security Acknowledgments

We thank the security research community for helping keep CARL secure. Researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be acknowledged (with permission) in our security advisories and release notes.
