# CARL Architecture: First Principles Design Document

## Executive Summary
CARL is a modular AI system integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) as a memory and comparison mechanism. The system is designed to be built from foundational AI building blocks, leveraging Vulkan for GPU acceleration and integrating C and Go for IO and API frameworks.

## Foundational Principles

### 1. Core AI Building Blocks
- **Mathematical Primitives**
  - Tensor operations, activation functions, and loss functions
  - Vulkan-accelerated compute shaders for GPU support

- **Neural Primitives**
  - Shared types for layers and networks (e.g., DenseLayer, ConvLayer)
  - Modular design for easy assembly into complex models

### 2. System Architecture

#### Low-Level Layer (C/Vulkan)
- Vulkan-based compute pipeline for tensor operations
- Memory management and kernel dispatch

#### Mid-Layer (Go/CGO)
- API and IO orchestration
- Integration with C libraries for performance-critical tasks

#### High-Level Model Assembly
- Use of shared primitives to construct RL, GAN, CNN, and SNN models
- Modular design for easy adaptation and extension

### 3. Memory Subsystem (SNN Core)
#### Neuromorphic Architecture
- **Spike Encoding Layer**: Convert tensor states to temporal spike patterns
- **Memory Banks**: 
  - Short-term plasticity buffers (STDP)
  - Long-term potentiation storage
- **Comparison Engine**: 
  - Spike-time difference analysis
  - Memory similarity scoring

#### RL Feedback Interface
- State-value memory indexing
- Reward prediction error signals
- Policy gradient memory priming

## Integration Protocols

#### CNN-RL Protocol (Self-Reflection)
- Feature extraction and decision-making loop
- Synchronization of CNN and RL updates

#### RL-GAN Protocol (Reward Center)
- Reinforcement-driven optimization of GAN outputs
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement

#### GAN-CNN Protocol (Imagination Engine)
- Data generation and analysis synergy
- Joint training for enhanced performance

#### SNN-RL Protocol (Cognitive Loop)
1. SNN observes RL policy executions
2. Encodes state-action-reward trajectories as spike patterns
3. Compares current states with memory engrams
4. Provides memory-weighted advantage estimates to RL
5. Updates memory engrams based on reward outcomes

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Development Phases

- **Phase 3**: Assemble core AI models using shared primitives (4 months)
- **Phase 4 (Expanded)**: SNN Integration
  - Subphase 4a: Spike-based memory encoding/retrieval (6 weeks)
  - Subphase 4b: Neuromorphic comparison engine (5 weeks)
  - Subphase 4c: RL feedback integration (5 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Implement and test integration protocols (3 months)

### 2. Target Datasets and Models
- **Datasets**: MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, WikiText, MIMIC-III
- **Models**: ResNet, DCGAN, DQN, SNN for memory

### 3. Performance Benchmarks
- **Hardware**: Cross-vendor GPU support (AMD/NVIDIA)
- **Metrics**: Convergence time, accuracy, resource efficiency
- **Goals**: FID < 20, Top-1 Accuracy â‰¥ 98%, Reward convergence within 100k steps

| Goal Metric             | Baseline         | Target           |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Memory recall latency   | 85ms (CPU)       | 12ms (Vulkan)    |
| Pattern match accuracy  | 78% (ANN)        | 92% (SNN)        |
| Memory density          | 1GB/1M samples   | 1GB/4M engrams   |

## Challenges and Considerations
- Efficient communication between C and Go layers
- Optimization of Vulkan shaders for diverse hardware
- Memory management across the stack
- Development of a "higher awareness" model for SNN integration
